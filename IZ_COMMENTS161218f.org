** Add detailed description in README

Part 1:  Describe the contents of each file.

Part 2: Describe how to install and run the system

** Corrections for file x-noia7.scd

1. Remove all double empty lines: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sclang
OSCdef.new(


        \selectsend,
#+END_SRC

Becomes:

#+BEGIN_SRC sclang
OSCdef.new(
        \selectsend,
#+END_SRC

2. Use the clean syntax form for if clauses :


: if (expression) { then code } { else code }

3. Declare interpreter variable r as  local variable in top closure of your top-level routine.

Name it =state_stream=.

Place the code for initializing its contents at the top of the top-level routine code, before the OSCdef.

3. Declare environment variable =~synth= as local variable in top closure of your top-level routine.
